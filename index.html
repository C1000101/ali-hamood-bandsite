                            The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San 
                            Francisco, California. The band consists a dynamic lineup 
                            featuring two lead vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a 
                            keyboardist and a drummer. The band achieved its first 
                            commercial success as an unsigned act, drawing attention from 
                            their future manager. Having extensive experience working with 
                            both new and seasoned acts, the manager was confident the 
                            band could succeed even further with more support, pushing The 
                            Bees Knees to sign with a well known record label
                        </p>
                        <p class="about__article-text">
                            From there, the band has soared, gaining international 
                            recognition and ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts. New 
                            fans immediately fell in love with the band’s original and organic 
                            attitude, solidifying their place as one of the hottest and fastest 
                            up and coming acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to 
                            themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to their candid and 
                            authentic performances on stage. The Bees Knees are currently 
                            recording their second studio album, looking to be released in 
                            early 2024.
